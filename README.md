This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variable:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CALCOM_URL=https://cal.com/your-username
```

Replace `your-username` with your Cal.com username. The URL can be:
- `https://cal.com/your-username` (will automatically use the embed version)
- `https://cal.com/your-username/embed` (explicit embed URL)

If this variable is not set, the contact section will display a placeholder message.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
